            <h2>UAAP: In men's swimming, Ateneo eyes wins eight straight titles.</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="news">
            <p><strong style="color:bisque;">Ateneo de Manila University</strong> aims for an unprecedented eighth consecutive UAAP men's swimming title in Season 86,
                set to kick off at the Teofilo Yldefonso Swimming Pool in Manila. The reigning champions, Blue Eagles, led by MVP Phillip Joaquin Santos,
               boast an intact lineup. Despite strong competition from La Salle, UP, and UST, Ateneo remains a formidable force. <br>
               Day 1 events include the 100m freestyle, 200m individual medley, 800m freestyle, 4x50m medley relay, and 4x200m freestyle relay.
              In the women's division, UP targets to dethrone La Salle, relying on veterans like Camille Buico and Erin Castrillo. <br>
               La Salle's Lady Tankers face challenges after the graduation of key players. High school competitions feature the UST Tiger Sharks eyeing a third consecutive 'golden double.'
               Events scheduled on Day 1 are 100m freestyle, 200m individual medley, 800m freestyle, 4x50m medley relay, and 4x200m freestyle relay. 
               <br><br><br>

               In the women's division, UP will try to end La Salle's reign as they parade a squad led by veteran international campaigners like Camille Buico and Erin Castrillo while bolstering their squad with rookies Quendy Fernandez, Atasha Dela Torre, and Juliana Villanueva.
               <br><br><br>

               The Fighting Maroons are looking to regain the crown they last won in Season 79 (2016).
               
               The Lady Tankers of La Salle will no longer have superstars Chloe Isleta (graduation) and Xiandi Chua (graduation), leaving Raven Alcoseba and Nikki Pamintuan to lead the way.
               <br><br>

               Ateneo will also not have last yearâ€™s multiple national record-breaker Thanya Dela Cruz (leave of absence) in this campaign. Instead, the Blue Eagles will lean on rookie Mishka Sy.
               <br><br>

               In the high school competitions, the young guns of the UST Tiger Sharks are aiming for a third straight 'golden double.'
